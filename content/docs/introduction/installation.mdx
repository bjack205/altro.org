## Installation
Altro.jl can be installed via the Julia package manager. Within the Julia
REPL:
```
] # activate the package manager
(v1.5) pkg> add Altro 
```
A specific version can be specified using
```
(v1.5) pkg> add Altro@0.5
```
Or you can check out the main branch with
```
(v1.5) pkg> add Altro#main
```
Lastly, if you want to clone the repo into your `.julia/dev/` directory for development, you can use
```
(v1.5) pkg> dev Altro 
```

This will automatically add all package dependencies (see [`Project.toml`](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/Altro.jl/blob/master/Project.toml)).
If you want to explicitly use any of these dependencies (such as [RobotDynamics.jl](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/RobotDynamics.jl)), 
you'll need to individually add those packages to your environment via the package manager.
