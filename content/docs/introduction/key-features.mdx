## Key Features <br/>

<br />

&nbsp;

- State-of-the-art performance for both convex (linear dynamics) and nonlinear trajectory optimization problems
- Convenient interface for dynamics and problem definition via [TrajectoryOptimization.jl](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/TrajectoryOptimization.jl) and [RobotDynamics.jl](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/RobotDynamics.jl).
- Supports generic nonlinear state and control constraints at each time step.
- Supports second-order-cone programs (SOCPs).
- Allows initialization of both state and control trajectories.
- Supports integration up to 4th-order Runge-Kutta methods. Higher-order methods are possible but not yet implemented.
- Supports implicit integration schemes such as implicit midpoint.
- Supports optimization on the space of 3D rotations.
- Provides convenient methods for warm-starting MPC problems.
- Provides efficient methods for auto-differentiation of costs, constraints, and dynamics via [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) and
  [FiniteDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/FiniteDiff.jl).
