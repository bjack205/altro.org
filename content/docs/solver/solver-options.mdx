## Solver Options

Like any nonlinear programming solver, ALTRO comes with a host of solver options.
While the default values yield good/acceptable performance on many problem, extra
performance can always be gained by tuning these parameters. In practice, there are
only a few parameters that need to be tuned. See the [AL-iLQR Tutorial](https://bjack205.github.io/papers/AL_iLQR_Tutorial.pdf) for more details.

The ALTRO solver is actually a composition of several different solvers with
their own options. Early versions of Altro.jl required the user to manipulate
a rather confusing heirarchy of solver options. Newer versions of Altro.jl
provide a single options struct that dramatically simplifies setting and
working with the solver parameters.

### Setting Solver Options

Solver options can be specified when the solver is instantiated or afterwards using
the `set_options!` command. If we have a previously constructed `Problem`, this looks
like

```julia
solver = ALTROSolver(prob, verbose=1, constraint_tolerance=1e-3, square_root=true)
```

Alternatively, solver options can be set using the `set_options!` command after the
solver has been instantiated:

```julia
set_options!(solver, reset_duals=true, penalty_initial=100, penalty_scaling=50)
```

### Querying Solver Options

The options struct for the `ALTROSolver` can be directly accessed via `solver.opts` or
`Altro.options(solver)`. Options can be directly set or retrieved from this mutable
struct.
