| `multiplier_projected`            | Enable updating the dual variables during the projected newton solve. Also provides a calculation of the optimality residual in the stats output.                                                                                                                                                   | Low         | `true`  |
| `ρ_chol`                          | Regularization on the projected newton Cholesky solve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Med         | `1e-2`  |
| `ρ_primal`                        | Regularization on the primal variables during the projected newton solve. Required if cost Hessian is positive-semi-definite.                                                                                                                                                                       | Low         | `1e-8`  |

| `r_threshold`                     | Improvement ratio threshold for projected newton solve. If the ratio of constraint violations between subsequent steps is less than this value, it will update the cost and constraint expansions                                                                                                   | Low         | `1.1`   |
| `projected_newton`                | Enable projected newton solve. If enabled, `projected_newton_solve` is used as the `constraint_tolerance` for the AL-iLQR solve. Projected newton solve is still a WIP and not very robust.                                                                                                         | High        | `true`  |

| `verbose`                         | Controls output during solve. `0` is zero output, `1` outputs AL iterations, and `2` outputs both AL and iLQR iterations                                                                                                                                                                            | Low         | `0`     |
